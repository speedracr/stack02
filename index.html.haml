          Berlin is a city with rich history and a colorful present, and very easy to get comfortable in for international visitors. Startups are a big thing here, so chances are, you'll feel right at home, meet great people and discover a city that is unlike any other.

          We can help you find accommodation in Berlin, if

          As an EU citizen, you can generally live and work in Berlin freely. Citizens of many other countries such as the United States, Canada and Israel can enter and stay in the EU for up to 90 days without a visa, which will suffice for the course, and may be able to extend their stay to a total of six months if looking for work. (The German Federal Foreign Office has more information on its

          Please make sure you know the requirements for your specific situation and contact us and the German embassy in your country when in doubt. Also let us know if you need assistance with German-language forms or requests.
          %br/
          Note that you will generally not be allowed to take on any kind of work in Berlin during your stay. However, should you seek a position in Berlin after the conclusion of the course and get hired, you will find that many employers are able to assist in the process of getting all necessary documentation for a longer-term residency as a non-EU citizen.
